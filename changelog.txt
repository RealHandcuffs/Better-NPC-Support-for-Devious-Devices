Version 0.1 Beta 1
- Refre​​​​​sh effects on NPC after NPC is (re)loaded by game engine.
- Refresh effects on NPC after NPC inventory changed.
- Sheathe weapons after bound NPC draws weapon, and try to keep them sheathed.
- Prevent usage of weapons/spells when NPC is wearing bondage mittens or is bound.
- Allow bound combat if enabled in DD settings and NPC's feet are free.
- Try to fix rendered items not being equipped (e.g. compatibility problems with mods like AllGUD).
- Try to fix the issue that giving a NPC a device is sometimes not registered by the game engine (often when the player has multiple identical devices in inventory).

​Version 0.1 Beta 2
- Fix: Mod can become stuck in certain situations, stopping to work.

Version 0.1 Beta 3
- Fix: Factions for combat packages were not cleaned up when NPCs were removed from the reference alias.

Version 0.1 Beta 4
- Recognize upgrades from one version to another one and try to handle the situation gracefully.
- Optimize all papyrus scripts after using the built-in profiler.
- Remember devices of NPCs as long as they are being tracked to prevent repeaded inventory scans.
- Try to be smarter about when to re-apply animations of a NPC (zadBoundCombatScript.EvaluateAA) as doing so is expensive and slow.
- Allow pausing the mod using "stopquest DDNF_NpcTracker". Use "startquest DDNF_NpcTracker" to start the mod again.

Version 0.1 Beta 5
- Detect concurrent modifications to a NPC while the mod is fixing up devices of the NPC and abort the fixup (fail fast).
- Reduce number of NPCs that can be found by the scanner quest from 8 to 4 (the mod is still able to handle more, it will just take longer to find them).
- Only allow fixing devices of a particular NPC every 5 seconds real time (slow down). This includes situations where the fixup was aborted.
- Only allow fixing devices of 3 NPCs over a period of 3 seconds (slow down).
- Various other small optimizations.
- Add very minimal logging. It is off by default and can be enabled using "setpqv DDNF_NpcTracker EnablePapyrusLogging true".

Version 0.1 RC 1
- Use a workaround to force the game to correctly hide body parts according to armor addon item slots (this fixes hands clipping out of elbowbinders).
- When scanning devices, check for each device if it has an enchantment; if not, assume it has no special functionality (e.g. heavy bondage, different animations).
- When unequipping and reequipping devices, skip devices that have no enchantment (they have no effect that needs to be restarted).
- Improve handling of weapons for bound followers: They should no longer try to draw weapons, and they should no longer run with one or both arms sticking out.

Version 0.1 RC 2
- Optimization: Detect if an added/removed device does not change the existing animations (e.g. when gagging bound NPCs) and skip refreshing animations in that case.
- Optimization: Refactor detection of keywords on devices, will hopefully reduce the amount of keyword checks for NPCs wearing many devices.
- Fix: Prevent NPCs with bondage mittens from using shields.

Version 0.1 RC 3
- Changes to improve compatibility with DDe (and possibly other mods that use non-standard ways of equipping and unequipping devices).

Version 0.1
- Tweaks to improve weapon handling of bound NPCs.

Version 0.2 beta 1
- Add a simple MCM with the following options:
  * enabled/disable processing of NPCs (can be used to temporarily disable the mod)
  * frequency of NPC scanner (default: scan for NPCs every 8 seconds)
  * how fast to process NPCs (default: 3 NPCs every 3 seconds)​​​​​

Version 0.2 beta 2
- Optimizations after testing with Devious Devices 5.1
- Add flag for papyrus logging to MCM

Version 0.2 beta 3

Version 0.2
- Support pahe dwemer slave suit and dwemer pet suit as a soft-dependency (they needed special handling)

Version 0.3 beta 1
- Add option to fix the NPC under the crosshair to MCM
- Optimization: Change handling of animations, should now recognize when animations are still applied after loading screen and not re-apply them

Version 0.3 beta 2
- Improve the fix for corrupt devices (devices sometimes get "bad" when they are stored in a container for a long time)
- Detect rendered devices being unequipped while NPC is loaded and try to fix the issue
- Prevent prisoners from using bound combat even if not wearing fetters (use membership in dunPrisonerFaction)

Version 0.3 beta 3
- Change handling of dummy weapon to prevent bug causing all equipped items to be unequipped

Version 0.3 beta 4
- Slightly increase delay after devices are added/removed to prevent race conditions with DD (could lead to lost animations e.g. after adding gags, or removed devices staying visually applied)

Version 0.3 beta 5
- Try to prevent bound NPCs from sandboxing (most of this depends on DD NPC slots being enabled and available)
- Add option to restore original outfit of NPCs after DD replaced it with empty outfit (false by default)

Version 0.3

- Some minor performance optimizations

Version 0.4 beta 2
- Add special handling for panel gags
- One more very minor performance optimization

Version 0.4 beta 3
- Check keywords of all devices, not just the ones with magic effects
- Use StorageUtil to speed up analysis of equipped devices by caching information for each "rendered device" that is encountered

Version 0.4 beta 4
- Add option to clear all cached data to MCM; this can be used for example after an update to DD that changes keywords of existing devices (not expected)
- Apply code changes to reduce the chance of race conditions leading to wrong animation sets or orphaned rendered devices

Version 0.4 beta 5
- Further refactoring to improve performance and to make the mod more reactive on changes to NPC inventory by player (container menu)

- Internal changes allowing to recalculate helpless/not helples without full fixup

Version 0.5 RC 2
- Small performance optimization (override DD bound NPC sandbox packages with custom script to prevent unnecessary EvaluateAA call)
- Clean masters of esp

Version 0.5 RC 3
- Change how the escape system recognizes NPCs that should not struggle, it now checks if their outfit contains devious devices
