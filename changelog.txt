Version 0.1 Beta 1
- Refre​​​​​sh effects on NPC after NPC is (re)loaded by game engine.
- Refresh effects on NPC after NPC inventory changed.
- Sheathe weapons after bound NPC draws weapon, and try to keep them sheathed.
- Prevent usage of weapons/spells when NPC is wearing bondage mittens or is bound.
- Allow bound combat if enabled in DD settings and NPC's feet are free.
- Try to fix rendered items not being equipped (e.g. compatibility problems with mods like AllGUD).
- Try to fix the issue that giving a NPC a device is sometimes not registered by the game engine (often when the player has multiple identical devices in inventory).

​Version 0.1 Beta 2
- Fix: Mod can become stuck in certain situations, stopping to work.

Version 0.1 Beta 3
- Fix: Factions for combat packages were not cleaned up when NPCs were removed from the reference alias.

Version 0.1 Beta 4
- Recognize upgrades from one version to another one and try to handle the situation gracefully.
- Optimize all papyrus scripts after using the built-in profiler.
- Remember devices of NPCs as long as they are being tracked to prevent repeaded inventory scans.
- Try to be smarter about when to re-apply animations of a NPC (zadBoundCombatScript.EvaluateAA) as doing so is expensive and slow.
- Allow pausing the mod using "stopquest DDNF_NpcTracker". Use "startquest DDNF_NpcTracker" to start the mod again.

Version 0.1 Beta 5
- Detect concurrent modifications to a NPC while the mod is fixing up devices of the NPC and abort the fixup (fail fast).
- Reduce number of NPCs that can be found by the scanner quest from 8 to 4 (the mod is still able to handle more, it will just take longer to find them).
- Only allow fixing devices of a particular NPC every 5 seconds real time (slow down). This includes situations where the fixup was aborted.
- Only allow fixing devices of 3 NPCs over a period of 3 seconds (slow down).
- Various other small optimizations.
- Add very minimal logging. It is off by default and can be enabled using "setpqv DDNF_NpcTracker EnablePapyrusLogging true".

Version 0.1 RC 1
- Use a workaround to force the game to correctly hide body parts according to armor addon item slots (this fixes hands clipping out of elbowbinders).
- When scanning devices, check for each device if it has an enchantment; if not, assume it has no special functionality (e.g. heavy bondage, different animations).
- When unequipping and reequipping devices, skip devices that have no enchantment (they have no effect that needs to be restarted).
- Improve handling of weapons for bound followers: They should no longer try to draw weapons, and they should no longer run with one or both arms sticking out.

Version 0.1 RC 2
- Optimization: Detect if an added/removed device does not change the existing animations (e.g. when gagging bound NPCs) and skip refreshing animations in that case.
- Optimization: Refactor detection of keywords on devices, will hopefully reduce the amount of keyword checks for NPCs wearing many devices.
- Fix: Prevent NPCs with bondage mittens from using shields.

Version 0.1 RC 3
- Changes to improve compatibility with DDe (and possibly other mods that use non-standard ways of equipping and unequipping devices).
